This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Wanderlist
=============

This is an app for those of us who organize their itineraries around amazing photos.

## To Download and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsasscer/wanderlist-web-app.git
npm install
```

You'll also need to create a developer account with Unsplash and register your application to get an [Unsplash API Key](https://unsplash.com/developers). Once you have your key, save it in an .env file in the root of the project like so:

```
REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_KEY=yourkeyhere
```

## To Run

This runs the app in development mode on `localhost:3000`.
```bash
npm start
```

## To Test

```bash
npm test
```

## To Build

```bash
npm run build
```
